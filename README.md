Please go through with the PDF provided for clear undertanding of the project.If the pdf is not supported to read , please download it as a raw file and read it.
Coming to the project working codes, run each code in Arduino UNO.
First Start with ESP8266 Initialization code for turning ON the ESP8266 wifi module which helps to send the accelerometer and time-of-flight sensor data to the ThinkSpeak Cloud storage.
Once it connected , run the second code i.e Full Integrated code to display the accelerometer and time-of-flight sensor readings.The accelerometer readings specifies the bail disturbance in wickets for successfull stumping attempt, correspondingly the time-of-flight readings specifies the where the batter stands during stumping attemp i.e either inside or outside the popping crease.
